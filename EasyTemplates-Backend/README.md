## ðŸ”§ Compiling

### Required software stack

```bash
* Java JDK & JRE >= 8 (1.8.x)
* Spring Tool Suite 4 (ver >= 4.15.2.RELEASE)
```

In order to try this project, you first need to clone the repository; by default (Unless specified) we'll clone the ```main``` branch.

To do so:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adriamilan-bootcamp/EasyTemplates-Backend
```

Right after, you'll need to import the repository into STS4 as a Maven project, next, STS will start processing the ```pom.xml``` file in order to gather the required Maven artifacts that need to exist in order for it to compile successfully.

As soon as it finished, you can build the Project as a ```Spring Boot``` Project.

Afterwards, once compilation finishes; a ```tomcat``` server will spawn at port 8080 (Be sure to check if it's available, in that case, change it for something else in the ```application.properties``` file) serving the project's backend.
